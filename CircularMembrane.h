// circular list
// commpute best position based on sharpness of angle b/w the two nodes
//	next node has to react to this position change, compute its own best pos considering the this new change in pos
// 	dont snap to best position immediately, just move in direction of current best position; so dont get erradic movements?

// result; real time membrane simulation, when apply force to point in memb, memb reacts to accomodate
